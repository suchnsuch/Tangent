Tangent has a [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/6VpvhUnxFe), a [Mastodon Handle](https://pkm.social/@tangentnotes), and  a [Twitter Handle](https://twitter.com/TangentNotes). Feel free to reach out on any platform if you have a suggestion, request, or need help.

Tangent is developed by [Taylor Hadden](https://twitter.com/Cptn_ChillPill), and you can bug me directly on Twitter if you like.

# Bug Reports
If you encounter a bug, I'm sorry! I hope you haven't lost any work. The best way to report a bug is by [opening a new issue on GitHub](https://github.com/suchnsuch/tangent-public/issues/new); however, you can also reach out on the Discord, Mastodon, or Twitter.

The best way I can help you fix a bug is if you can be as specific as possible. Any of these resources can be very helpful:

1. The version of Tangent you are using.
2. A list of steps you took to make the problem happen.
3. Screenshots of any visual errors.
4. Screenshots of any errors in the console (which can be opened with `Cmd/Ctrl+Alt+I`).
