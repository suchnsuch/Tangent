Tangent has a [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/6VpvhUnxFe) and a [Mastodon Handle](https://mastodon.social/@tangentnotes). Feel free to reach out on either platform if you have a suggestion, request, or need help.

Tangent is developed by [Taylor Hadden](https://mastodon.social/@taylorhadden), and you can talk to me directly on Mastodon if you prefer.

# Bug Reports
If you encounter a bug, I'm sorry! I hope you haven't lost any work. The best way to report a bug is by [opening a new issue on GitHub](https://github.com/suchnsuch/Tangent/issues/new); however, you can also reach out on the Discord or Mastodon.

The best way I can help you fix a bug is if you can be as specific as possible. Any of these resources can be very helpful:

1. The version of Tangent you are using.
2. A list of steps you took to make the problem happen.
3. Screenshots of any visual errors.
4. Screenshots of any errors in the console (which can be opened with `Cmd/Ctrl+Alt+I`).
