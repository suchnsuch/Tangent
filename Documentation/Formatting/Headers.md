You can mark a line as a header by adding `#` characters to the beginning of the line. A single `#` will create the largest, __H1__ header, while more `#` characters will create __H2__, __H3__ headers, and so on. For example:

```md
# This will be an H1 Header

### This will be an H3 Header
```

The space between the `#` characters and the text of the header is required.

You can use `Cmd/Ctrl+1` through `Cmd/Ctrl+6` to set the header level for the currently selected line or lines. `Cmd/Ctrl+0` clears the header formatting and sets the lines back to being paragraphs.
