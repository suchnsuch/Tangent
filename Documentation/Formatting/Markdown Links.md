Tangent will recognize raw links and make them linkable. For example: http://tangentnotes.com.

You can create standard markdown links ([such as this](https://twitter.com/TangentNotes)) using the following syntax: `[link text](https://some.url.com)`.

You can follow a link by command-clicking on Mac or control-clicking on Windows. You can also follow a link that the typing cursor is hovering over by pressing `Command+Enter` on Mac or `Control+Enter` on Windows.

The web link shortcut is `Command+K` on Mac and `Control+K` on Windows.
* Pressing the shortcut with the typing cursor on a word or a selection of text will convert that text to an empty link, such as `[your selected text]()`.
* With a url in your clipboard, pressing the shortcut will automatically convert the current word or selected text to a full link.
* With the typing cursor over a raw url, pressing the shortcut will convert the url to a standard link with the webpage's title.
* With the typing cursor over a formatted markdown link, pressing the shortcut will strip out the link, leaving the text in its place.

# Local Markdown Links
Markdown links can also be used to link to files and folders on your local computer with relative or absolute paths.

Links that resolve to a file within the workspace are highlighted in your accent color (default green). Clicking these links will open the file within Tangent. If Tangent cannot display that file, the file will be opened in its default application.

Links that resolve elsewhere are highlighted in purple. Clicking on these links will open the linked file or folder in its default application for your system.
