Comments let you mark up meta-commentary on the text of your notes. They can be treated as an aside, or as notes to yourself in the middle of writing.

You invoke a comment by typing two slashes: // The rest of the line after those slashes becomes a comment.

// Comments can contain _italics_, __bolded text__, and even [[Wiki Links|links]].

Comments are designed to be easily stripped out of notes when published or exported.

You can press `Cmd+/` on Mac or `Ctrl+/` elsewhere to toggle comments for a line, or for multiple lines.
