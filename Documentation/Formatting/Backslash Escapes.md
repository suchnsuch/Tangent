The backslash character prevents the character immediately following it from being recognized as a formatting character. For example \_this\_ was not italicized because the underscores were written as `\_`.

Since the backslash is hidden when used like this, you can type a \\ by using two: `\\`.

This is useful to write out exactly what you want without the formatting syntax making a mess of it.
