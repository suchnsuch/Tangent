Sessions keep track of your actions as you create, open, and connect notes. These actions build up a connected map of where you've gone in your notes and how you got there.

A new session is automatically created when you interact with Tangent 8 hours after your last tracked action. This keeps your maps relevant even when you haven't looked at them for weeks.

The [[Map View]] shows the map of your current session, as well as the maps of any previous sessions that you have not yet archived.
