The attachments options for Tangent are found in the [[System Menu]].

The __Pasted Image Folder__ setting lets you choose where [[Embedding|Embedded Images]] go by default when pasted into notes.
* This setting supports relative paths by prefixing with `./` or `../`. A path of `./` would save images as siblings of the note they are pasted into.
* The `$filename` token will inject the name of the file into the target directory. This allows you to collect pasted images together according to where they were pasted.
