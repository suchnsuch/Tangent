Tangent will automatically update when new versions are released.

The options relevant to updates are found in the [[System Menu]].

# Update Channels
There are three update channels to which you can subscribe. Each channel will get updates more frequently than the last.

## Stable
Versions released on this channel have been—to some extent—tested and verified. Features distributed in the stable channels will have been developed over the course of multiple updates in the Beta and Alpha channels.

## Beta
Versions enter the Beta release cycle when all large features have been completed and development has turned to finding and fixing bugs. Naturally, if you use this channel, you may encounter those bugs! If you do, don't forget to send [[Feedback]].

## Bleeding Edge (Alpha)
The Bleeding Edge is as close to the source as you can get. If you subscribe to this update channel, your risk of hitting serious bugs is higher than the previous channels. However, you will get to see new features as soon as they are implemented. [[Feedback]] at this stage can have a massive impact on what finally takes shape.
