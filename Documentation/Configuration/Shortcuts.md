The shortcuts menu lets you configure the keyboard shortcuts for the various actions within Tangent. To change a shortcut, click on its binding button. To add a new shortcut, click on the "plus" button.

Once you are editing a shortcut, simply press the keys that you want to use. Pressing "Escape" will cancel and revert back to the previous state.

Customized shortcuts will display a "Reset" button. Clicking on this button will revert the shortcut back to its defaults. Some actions do not have shortcuts by default, but you can always access them through the [[Command Palette]].
