The database options for Tangent are found in the [[System Menu]].

# Dirty File Indicators
Tangent automatically saves your notes five seconds after you finish typing or as soon as your note loses focus. Because of this, it has no dirty file indicators by default; you should be able to work without worrying about when your file saves.

The "Show Dirty File Indicators" options let you display dirty indicators when a file has not saved yet (and `Cmd/Ctrl+S` will save your file immediately as is standard). The various options allow you to choose how intrusive these indicators will be to your editing experience.

# Case Sensitivity
Enabling __Case Sensitive Links__ will require that the text of [[Wiki Links]] must match the case of their linked notes precisely in order for the link to complete.

With this checkbox disabled, `[[example note]]`, `[[Example note]]`, and `[[eXaMpLe NoTe]]` would be successfully linked to a note named "Example Note" .
