The system-wide configuration for the [[Map View]] is found in the [[System Menu]].

The **Zoom & Pan** setting defines how scrolling the Map View zooms and pans the map.
	* __Pinch-to-Zoom__ is designed for trackpad interaction. Horizontal & vertical scrolling pans the map. Pinching in or out zooms the map in or out. In this mode, you can also hold the `Ctrl` key and scroll with the mouse wheel to zoom.
	* __Scroll-to-Zoom__ is designed for mouse scroll wheel interaction. Scrolling the scroll wheel zooms the map in and out.
	* In either mode, you can drag on the background of the map to pan.

The __Zoom Sensitivity__ setting determines how quickly the map's zoom level changes as you manipulate it.

When **Open Map When Last File Closed** is enabled, closing the last file in your [[Thread View]] will automatically switch to the [[Map View]].

Enabling **Show Previous Threads** gives you a visualization of previous threads on the [[Map View]], letting you quickly switch to a previous thread.

Enabling **Show Node Icons** will display the icons of the file the node represents in the [[Map View]]. These are the same icons that are used in [[The Sidebar]] and the [[Command Palette]].
