The Notes options for Tangent are found in the [[System Menu]].

# Appearance Options
__Note Font__ will let you select from any font on your system to render notes.

__Code Font__ will let you select from any font on your system to render code within your notes.

__Font Size__ configures the size of text within the title and body of notes.

__Line Height__ sets how much space there is between line of text.

__Max Note Width__ sets how wide note text will get before wrapping. If this value is larger than the Min Panel Width setting (as it is by default), note width will be additionally shrunk to fit into the smaller panel size when panels start to overlap.

The __Margins__ option gives you a choice on now much white space there is between notes, headers, and note titles. __Tight__ will let you achieve more information density. __Relaxed__ will give your content more breathing space.

Enabling the __Floating Title__ option will keep the title of notes at the top of their pane as you scroll down. This is particularly useful in the [[Feed Lens]], as the title of partially-visible notes is always visible.

The __Hanging Headers__ setting controls whether or not H1, H2, and H3 [[Headers]] will stick out to the left of normal body text. Disabling this setting will actually give all content more horizontal space.

# Editing Options
The **Default Bold/Italics Characters** settings let you choose which characters will be used when using the `Ctrl/Cmd+B` and `Ctrl/Cmd+I` shortcuts, respectively.

The __Use Spell Check__ toggle will control whether or not spell check should be enabled across your notes.

__Additional Spell Check Languages__ lets you add additional languages to your spell check dictionary in addition to the default language of your system. Unfortunately, this option is _not_ available on Mac.

## Smart Paragraph Breaks
Enabling the __Smart Paragraph Breaks__ option will automatically insert a blank link when you press Enter in a paragraph. Additionally, deleting a paragraph with Backspace in front of any empty line will delete the empty line automatically.

When this setting is enabled, holding Shift while pressing Enter or Backspace will avoid this automatic behavior.

# Code Options
**Extra Wide Code** allows code blocks to expand outside of the normal width of a note. This can be very helpful when looking at code from verbose codebases.
