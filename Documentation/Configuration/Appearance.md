The appearance options for Tangent are found in the [[System Menu]].

The __Appearance__ option lets you choose whether Tangent runs in light mode or dark mode. By default, Tangent takes on the setting of your operating system, if available.

__Accent Hue__ and __Accent Saturation__ let you customize the color used for highlighting [[Wiki Links]], [[Code|inline code]], and some button states. Adjustments to these values are made depending on how the color is used. Light and Dark mode also affect the final color used.

__UI Font Size__ lets you configure the size of text and icons outside of notes themselves.

The __Min Panel Width__ option sets the minimum size of sliding panels in the [[Thread View]]. Panels will always fill all available space before before collapsing. This setting determines how quickly panels will start overlapping.

The __Scroll Bar Width__ option, available on Windows and Linux, lets you control the thickness of scroll bars. Their default size, small, is intended to be as low-profile as possible while you scroll with a mouse wheel or gestures. The larger sizes are better suited to clicking and dragging on the scroll thumb.

The **Sidebar Hotspot** setting determines how close to the side your mouse cursor needs to be in order to summon the sidebar when hidden.
