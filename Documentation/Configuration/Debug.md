The debug options for Tangent are found in the [[System Menu]]. These options are only displayed when the [[Updates#Update Channels|update channel]] is set to "Beta" or "Alpha".

**Send Crash Reports** configures whether or not crashes should be uploaded should Tangent crash. This option is _disabled_ by default.

Disabling the  **Links Can Create Virtual Files** option will prevent Tangent from indexing [[Wiki Links]] to files that don't yet exist. Disabling this option _will_ cause issues with several of Tangent's features, and is should only be used for troubleshooting.
