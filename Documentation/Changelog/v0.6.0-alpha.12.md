+ Added support for Shift+Clicking and Cmd/Ctrl+Clicking on nodes in the [[Map View]] to add nodes to your current thread.
+ Added a "Show All Outgoing Connections in Map" command that adds all connections originating from the current note or folder to the [[Map View]].
+ Added icons to the nodes in the [[Map View]], with the option to turn them off in settings.
+ Improved display of folder children from folder nodes in the [[Map View]].
- Fixed an issue where thread changes that created modification to the [[Map View]] caused there to be two undo events for the map rather than one.
- Fixed an issue where previous threads would not show up in the thread history visualization on the [[Map View]] if they only differed from other threads by connection.
- Fixed an issue where the descriptions of map connections were not accurate to the new connection model.
- Fixed a issue where the top or left side bars would remain open even when the mouse left the window.
- Fixed an issue where sorting by name in the [[Feed Lens]] or [[Cards Lens]] could sort nodes with names like "My Note-11" before "My Note-9". Sorting by name now matches the behavior in the sidebar.
