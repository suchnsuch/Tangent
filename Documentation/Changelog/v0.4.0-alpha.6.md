+ Improved sentence highlighting with significantly better end-of-sentence detection. Now other punctuation (!, ?), and dot.notation work as expected.
+ Added autocomplete help to the Query editor.
+ Added the ability to create a new file from the `Ctrl/Cmd+O` file search menu.
+ Added a "copy url" action to external links.
+ Made the middle mouse button open links, mirroring Ctrl/Cmd + left mouse button.
+ Added experimental RTL language support. I do not use and cannot  read RTL languages, so feedback is very much necessary!
- Fixed a regression where the tops of cards were not rounded correctly.
