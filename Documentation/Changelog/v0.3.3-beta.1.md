+ Updates to typewriter v0.7.11
+ Added support for opening links within the same panel with `Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+Click`
+ Added support for opening local files and folders that are not part of the workspace via markdown links.
- Fixed an issue where pasting an image copied from a browser (and thus containing both text and image data) could cause both a markdown image using the image's url and a wiki link to the pasted embedded image. Tangent now just uses the embedded image.
