+ Added a simple tag tree view that displays the tags in your workspace and lets you view the notes connected to those tags.
+ Changed the trigger requirements of tag autocomplete so that autocomplete does not start until the first character after `#` has been pressed. This prevents awkward interactions when writing headers.
+ Added a "Command/Control+\\" shortcut while in tag autocomplete that prepends a backslash before the `#`, disabling the tag. Useful for when you want to refer to "item \#4", for example.
- Fixed an issue where checkboxes were vertically centered on their line when the line wrapped. Checkboxes are now correctly aligned to the top of their line.
