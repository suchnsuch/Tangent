This update is a small grab back of fixes and improvements.

+ Added keyboard shortcuts for bold/italics with `Ctrl/Cmd+B` and `Ctrl/Cmd+I`, respectively.
+ Updated the "Create Newâ€¦" buttons for [[Creation Rules]] that show up in [[Lenses]] to always create new notes within the context of their parent.
	* This means creating new notes within a log view will always display that note in the log view, etc.
+ Updated how the [[Focus Modes]] are presented to the [[Command Palette]], and added the "Toggle Map View" command.
+ Updated the [[Command Palette]] to show and sort by whether or not the command can be executed.
* Changed the coloring of the horizontal rule to be more muted.
- Fixed a number of issues surrounding notes with periods in their names.
- Fixed a regression that caused scrolling in notes to get strange at the bottom, revealing note details.
