Changes since version v0.3.3:
+ Multiple improvements to handling of html content on paste. Html conversion code is open sourced in the [tangent-public repository](https://github.com/suchnsuch/tangent-public).
- Fixed several issues relating to how Tangent's editor interacts with IMEs:
	* Windows 10's emoji selector should no longer produce duplicate characters.
	* Dictation on Mac should work correctly.
	* Other IMEs should function correctly.
- Fixed an issue where the [[Feed Lens]] would not consistently auto-load notes when "Start At" was set to "Beginning".
- Fixed a potential crash that could occur when initializing a workspace. Cleaned up logs and added user messaging on this problem.
- Fixed an issue where cards in the card view did not always load in while scrolling.
- Fixed an issue where documentation wasn't allowed to fully update before changelogs were queried.
- Fixed an issue where deleting an emoji or other compound unicode character was not handled correctly.
