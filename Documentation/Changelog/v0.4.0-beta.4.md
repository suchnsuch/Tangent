+ Added support for referencing [[Queries]] within queries via `[[wiki link]]` syntax. Queries referenced in this way are equivalent to writing the referenced query as a subquery.
+ Changed the behavior of queries like `Notes in {Folders named 'foo'}`.
	* `in <subquery>` is now a raw "are items in this set" check.
		* This allows for using saved queries as a base set and winnowing down from there.
		* e.g. `Notes in [[My Saved Note Query]] with 'other text'`
	* Use `Notes in any {Folders named 'foo'}` to find notes in any folder with 'foo' in its name.
+ Added support for `with any {<subquery>}` or `with all {<subquery>}` queries for checking that items contain any or all of the results of a given subquery.
