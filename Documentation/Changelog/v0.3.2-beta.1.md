+ Refactored how keyboard shortcuts are handled.
- Fixed an issue where the zoom in/out shortcuts on windows didn't work.
- Changed "Reset Zoom" to `Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+0` to avoid collision with the paragraph shortcut.
- Changed "Zoom In" / "Zoom Out" to `Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+Plus` and `Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+Minus` respectively.
- Changed "Toggle Highlight" to `Cmd/Ctrl+Equals`
