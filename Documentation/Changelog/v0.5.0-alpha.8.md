+ Added full indexing & querying of [[Formatting/Tags#Tags In Front Matter|Front Matter Tags]].
+ Added autocomplete support for tags in the query editor.
+ Added support for copying an entire line when no text is selected.
* Made the cursor color never change, regardless of color the text is.
* Improved search sort tuning, hopefully promoting what you expect to find above others.
- Fixed a regression where `Alt+Up` from the bottom line did not work.
- Fixed an issue where clicking on some autocomplete menu items in the query editor did not select those items.
