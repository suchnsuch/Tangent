- Fixed an issue where session maps did not correctly swap out nodes & connections when a virtual note was removed due to another note being renamed into its place.
- Fixed an issue where virtual notes were not being correctly communicated between the backend & front end.
- Fixed a bug where renaming a note to the same name as a folder-scoped virtual link would incorrectly stomp & redirect the virtual note and its connections.
	- e.g. having `[[My Folder/My Note]]` somewhere and renaming a note to "My Note".
- Fixed a bug where moving a note in a folder over a virtual note updated notes linking to the moved note to use the folder path when that was not necessary.
