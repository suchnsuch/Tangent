+ Made zooming on the map mouse-relative. This makes zooming much more comfortable.
- Fixed an issue where map nodes could be positioned incorrectly if the map was toggled off and on while zoomed out.
- Fixed an issue where there could be a graphical flicker as the checkbox visualization appeared.
- Fixed an issue where tag autocomplete did not trigger when the tag was the first thing in a note.
