+ Added the option to open links to the left of the current pane with `Cmd/Ctrl+Alt+Click` or `Cmd/Ctrl+Alt+Enter`.
+ Markdown links inferred to point to files outside of the workspace now show up as "untracked" purple links.
+ Added alert messages when trying to follow an untracked link fails.
+ Added a setting that opens the [[Map View]] when the last item in a Thread is closed. This is enabled by default.
+ Added a setting that shows the word count of notes in the [[Cards Lens]]. This is on by default.
- Fixed an issue where toggling bold/italic/etc at the end of a word with a collapsed selection placed the cursor inside of the resulting formatting characters rather than outside.
