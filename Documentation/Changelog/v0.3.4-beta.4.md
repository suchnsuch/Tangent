- Fixed several issues relating to how Tangent's editor interacts with IMEs:
	* Windows 10's emoji selector should no longer produce duplicate characters.
	* Dictation on Mac should work correctly.
	* Other IMEs should function correctly.
- Fixed an issue where deleting an emoji or other compound unicode character was not handled correctly.
