- Fixed an issue that caused relative markdown links to in-workspace markdown files to not work correctly.
	- This involved a refactor of the primary link resolution mechanism. It should be better, but there may be bugs!
- Updated the light/dark appearance setting to also affect the appearance of context menus and native file selection dialogs.
- Fixed a handful of issues related to the `Cmd/Ctrl+Alt+K` "toggle wiki link" shortcut.	
	- Linking a word at the end of a line will no longer overstep to the next line.
	- Creating a link that resolves to a known item no longer opens the autocomplete menu.
	- Creating a link that resolves to a known item that doesn't match case exactly will now make the text match the name of the item being linked to.
- Fixed an issue where the `End` key would always send you to the end of the logical line instead of the end of the visual line.
