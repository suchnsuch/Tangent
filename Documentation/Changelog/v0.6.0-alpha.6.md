+ Added classes for empty lines and exposed a property for which line has the current selection.
+ Added the current folder of a note to the "Move to another folder" command modal.
+ Added support for pressing `Shift+Enter` while in [[Wiki Links#Autocomplete|wiki link autocomplete]] to close out of autocomplete with the current link text. This helps when creating new notes with names similar to already existing notes.
+ Made the transition out of [[Focus Modes|typewriter focus]] smoother to (mostly) match the transition in.
+ Updated header text indexing to strip link formatting out of headers. Now headers like `# My Header [with web link](etc..)` will show up like "My Header with web link".
- Fixed an issue where trying to create files nested in folders that did not yet exist failed.
- Fixed a regression where `Cmd/Ctrl+N` was not navigating to the newly created note.
- Fixed an issue where bad session data could cause threads to not display.
- Fixed an issue where displaying multiple shortcuts in the [[Command Palette]] looked terrible.
- Fixed an issue where code overlapped the header in cards in the [[Cards Lens]].
- Fixed an issue where making a new line in the [[Focus Modes|line and sentence focus modes]] made that line shift to the left out of alignment with other lines.
