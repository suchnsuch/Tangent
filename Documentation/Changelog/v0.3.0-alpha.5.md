+ __Added support for editing and creating [[Creation Rules]] for notes.__
	* Creation Rules let you create quick actions for making new notes with templated names in specific locations.
	* Rules show up in the "New Note" button and in the [[Command Palette]].
	* Tangent ships with "Inbox Note" and "Daily Note" rules by default, mirroring previous functionality.
+ Exposed tooltips for commands in the [[Command Palette]].
- Fixed an issue where new files might not be added to the internal file mapping.
- Fixed an issue where cancelling setting the "Attachments" folder caused the value to be reset.
- Fixed an issue where threads with duplicate files could break the UI.
