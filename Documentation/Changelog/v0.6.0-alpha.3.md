+ Added support for embedded [[KaTeX Equations]] for LaTeX-based math and chemical equations, in both block & inline forms. For example:
$$
H = \frac{f^2}{Nc} + f
$$
+ Updated the default "Daily Note" creation rule to automatically place the notes in "YYYY/MMâ€“Month" folders.
+ When invoking a creation rule that does not have naming customizations from a Folder or other Set, the "name the new note" dialogue is skipped.
+ Added the ability to focus on the current node in the [[Map View]] by pressing the `F` key.
* Updated Svelte to v4, Typescript to v5, and Electron to v25. You don't care, but I do!
* Tweaked the Back & Forward history buttons so that the current history item shows up at the top of the list.
- Fixed an issue where closing a window that is open to the "Open Workspace" screen caused an error.
- Fixed an issue where changing the current note in the [[Feed Lens]] did not update the current note of the [[Thread History]].
- Fixed an issue where pop-up button menus could remain open when others were invoked.
- Fixed an issue where you could interact with the maps of previous [[Sessions]].
- Fixed a display regression with the file search display.
- Restricted backslash escapes to only affect markdown formatting characters.
