+ Adds support for [[Sessions]] and multiple [[Map View]]s!
	* Connection & Navigation history is tracked in Tangent Sessions.
	* New [[Sessions]] are automatically started 8 hours after the last interaction with the previous Session.
	* Each session gets its own map. The Map View now shows the maps from all loaded sessions.
	* Previous sessions can be archived to remove them from the Map View.
	* The current session can be merged with the previous session.
+ Sessions contain a [[Thread History]], allowing you to go back and forward.
	* Right click on the Back/Forward buttons in the top bar to show a list of history items.
	* Go back and forward with the  `Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+[` and `Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+]` keyboard shortcuts.
+ Reorganized the `.tangent` folder in workspaces.
	* Your previous map and threads will _not_ be migrated over to the new system.
	* The previous `.tangent` folder will be backed up as `.tangent-YYYY-MM-DD-hh-mm`. If the conversion completes successfully, you can delete this folder.
	* References to note paths in files in the `.tangent` folder now use a `FILES/` prefix to represent the root of the workspace. This allows a workspace to be moved without losing track of map nodes and threads.
+ Added tooltip text for commands selected by the arrow keys in the [[Command Palette]].
