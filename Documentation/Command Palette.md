The command palette is a quick and easy way to jump around to different notes and perform different actions just by using the keyboard.

# Go To File
`Cmd/Ctrl+O` opens up the raw palette, which serves as a "go to" system. By default, this will list out files you have recently edited. By typing, you can search for a specific file or [[Tags|Tag]], select the right one with the cursor keys, and hit `Enter` to set that item as the root of a new [[Thread View|thread]]. You can also press `Cmd/Ctrl+Enter` to add the selected file to the end of your current thread.

# Go To Tag
By prefixing your search with a `#` character, you can explicitly search only for tags within your workspace.

# Invoke Commands
`Cmd/Ctrl+P` opens up the palette with a `>` prefix, placing the palette into "command" mode. This lists all commands available to the palette. You can type to search for an appropriate command, use the cursor keys to select, and hit `Enter` to run the command.

Some commands, like the "Move File to another folder" command, will present sub-menus that ask you to specify further. If you want to cancel such an action, pressing `Escape` will move you back to the command palette.
