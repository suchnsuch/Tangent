![[Thread View Button.png|110]]

The Thread View is the default view mode of Tangent. When you open a note from [[The Sidebar]] or the [[Command Palette]], it becomes the root of the thread.

When you follow a [[Wiki Links|wiki link]] in a note, the linked note is added to the end thread, replacing any other notes that were previously after the source note. Even though notes are replaced, this context is not lost: the [[Map View]] 

The notes in your Thread stack up from left to right in a series of sliding panels. Sliding panels let you follow your train of thought deeply into a rabbit hole while retaining a clear and obvious thread from where you started.

A very full thread can be overwhelming. If you want to keep the state of your thread, but dial in on a single note, you can use one of the [[Focus Modes]].

# Shortcuts
- `Cmd/Ctrl+Alt+Left` and `Cmd/Ctrl+Alt+Right` will jump to the previous and next note in the thread, respectively.
- `Cmd/Ctrl+W` will close the active panel, removing it from the thread.
- `Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+W` will close all panels _except_ for the active panel, leaving it the only item in the thread.
