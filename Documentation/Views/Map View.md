The Map View provides a bird's-eye view of where you are and how you got there.

Every file you open, follow through a link, or link to from another file is added to your map as a Node. Nodes are connected to one another with wires. Nodes and connections display the date they were first created by mousing over them.

Each [[Sessions|Session]] gets its own map, with the maps of previous sessions shown above the current session.

You can pan and zoom the map view by scrolling, pinching, and clicking & dragging. These actions are configurable in the [[Maps|Maps settings]]. You can also press the `F` to focus on the currently selected node.

# Thread Selection
Nodes that are in your [[Thread View]] are given a colored border and displayed with thick connection lines. The current node is completely filled with color.

You can change your current node simply by clicking on it or using the arrow keys. If you change the current node to one that is not in the current thread, the thread will be reset.

You can create new threads from the Map in a number of ways.
1. You can click on a connection between to nodes to create a thread of those two nodes.
2. You click and hold on a starting node or connection and drag across other nodes to create a thread with the nodes you pass through.
3. You can hold `Shift` and navigate with the arrow keys to extend your current thread.

If **Show Previous Threads** is enabled in [[Maps|Maps Settings]], previous threads will visible on the map in different colors. You can hover over these colored connections to see the full thread. Clicking on a colored connection will restore the entire previous thread.

# Node Manipulation
When something in your map is distracting you from what you want to focus on, you can remove it via the node's context-menu or by selecting it and pressing the `Delete` key. You can remove connections by holding `Alt` and clicking on the wire between nodes.

If you accidentally add or remove something from the map and you want it back, you can undo or redo changes with the standard shortcut keys.
