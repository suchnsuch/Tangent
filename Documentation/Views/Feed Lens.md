The Feed Lens is one of many [[Lenses]] that can be used to visualize multiple files.

This lens lazily loads more files above or below as you scroll.

The Feed has been designed primarily around being used to view journal entries. The default settings will sort standard timestamped note titles (e.g. 2021-05-02, 2022-01-22) in order oldest to newest. The feed will start from the newest note and let you scroll up to see previous entries.

# Settings
## Sorting
You can select both the key that files will be sorted by and the direction (ascending/descending).

## Start At
This setting determines whether the feed starts from the first item or the last item by default. If you start from the last item, you will scroll up to see the rest of your files. If you start from the first, you will scroll down.

The feed will load files below the starting file so long as there is room. If you want your feed to be as simple as possible when you first open it, I recommend starting with the last item.
