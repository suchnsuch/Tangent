When you want to isolate a single note from the [[Thread View]], you can invoke one of the four Focus Modes. Each mode builds on the previous mode, helping further narrow your focus.

1. **File focus** will present the current note as if it were the only note in the Thread.
2. **Typewriter focus** will additionally ensure that your typing cursor remains in the center of the screen as you type and move around.
3. **Paragraph focus** will additionally fade out all text except for your current line and all adjacent lines with content.
4. **Line focus** will fade out all text except for your current line.
5. **Sentence focus** fades out all text except for your current sentence.

In all of these modes, the top bar and [[The Sidebar]] are automatically hidden by default. If you summon the sidebar while in a focus mode, the top bar will return as well.

These modes can be very helpful when you want to emphasize free-flowing thought and not get distracted by what is already there.

# Shortcuts
- `Cmd/Ctrl+D` will toggle between the last used focus mode and the [[Thread View]].
- Pressing `Escape` will also return you to the [[Thread View]] when in a Focus Mode.
- You can move between [[Map View]], [[Thread View]], and the various focus modes by pinch-zooming on a multi-touch trackpad.
- The `Cmd/Ctrl+Alt+Left/Right` shortcuts for moving to the previous or next note in the Thread still work in the focus mode.
