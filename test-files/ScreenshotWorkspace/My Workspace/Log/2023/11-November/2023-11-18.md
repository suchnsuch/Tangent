I've been preparing a presentation on [[Project Zebra]] these past few days to show to [[Derrick Marshal]] and the rest of upper management. I want to highlight:
* Our team has pulled off some incredible feature velocity.
* The design quality bar is the highest we've achieved so far as a company.
* User focus groups have been going well. We're getting a lot of positive responses and quite a bit of useful feedback.

I do think we need to strengthen our QA practices. We have an _okay_ automated testing suite, but it's not hitting every aspect of the experience. We either need to invest more in hitting the more ephemeral aspects of the user experience with automated tests or we need to expand our QA department.
