> As a Project Administrator, I want to track ticket updates efficiently, So that I can stay informed about the progress of tasks and address any issues promptly.

* [x] As a user, I should be able to view a timeline of updates for each ticket.
* [] Updates should include comments, status changes, and any attachments made to the ticket.
* [] I should be able to filter ticket updates based on criteria such as date range, ticket status, or assigned team member.
* [] Filters should provide a customized view to focus on specific aspects of the project.	
* [] Receive real-time notifications when a ticket is updated.
* [] Notifications should be customizable to alert for specific types of updates or priority changes.
