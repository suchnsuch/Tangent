#status/in-progress

>As a project manager, I want to easily access a comprehensive overview of the current status of my projects within the administration app. This will help me make informed decisions, communicate progress to stakeholders, and ensure that the project is on track.

* [x] When I log in to the administration app, I should be greeted with a visually appealing and intuitive dashboard.
* [x] The dashboard should provide a high-level summary of all active projects, including key metrics such as overall progress, milestones achieved, and upcoming deadlines.
* [x] Each project on the dashboard should be represented by a distinct card, displaying essential information such as project name, current status, and team members involved.
* [x] The project cards should be clickable, redirecting me to the detailed project view for more in-depth information.
* [ ] Within each project card, there should be a clear visual indicator of the project's progress, such as a progress bar or percentage completion.
* [ ] Progress indicators should dynamically update based on real-time changes in project status.
* [ ] The overview should include a snapshot of the project timeline, highlighting important milestones and deadlines.
* [ ] I should be able to customize the timeline view to focus on specific timeframes (e.g., weekly, monthly) for a more granular analysis.
