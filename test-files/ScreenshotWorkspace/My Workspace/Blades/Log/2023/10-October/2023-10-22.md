[[The Sunken]] meets for the first time. The crew establishes itself in [[The Docks]].

They end up paying [[The Wraiths]] for access to [[The Silkshore]]. They also somewhat endear themselves to [[The Docks]] to steal a boat from [[The Gondoliers]].

In their first heist, they end up semi-fumbling their way through stealing the payroll box of [[The Gondoliers]].
