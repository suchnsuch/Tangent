[[The Sunken]] engaged in their second heist today. They followed [[Reginald Pinkerworthy]] home after a drunken—but productive!—night out at a casino in [[The Silkshore]]. While they trailed him home to [[Brightstone]], they chanced into an encounter with [[Elenzo Broadspike]], a low-to-mid-level agent of [[The Wraiths]]. Elenzo ended up with [[Bastion]]'s throwing knife in the thigh.

Once they got to Reginald's house, they cased the joint briefly before [[Naria Helles|Naria]] and [[Arvo Daltless|Arvo]] tried knocking on the front door to "return Reginald's wallet."

It did not go well. Turned out Regi's butler was in fact a vampire: one [[Kaisik Fogmoon]]. The encounter ends with Naria and Arvo nearly being dragged into the basement for some kind of horrifying elderich ritual. Naria is quick with her sword cane, and [[Anat]] and [[Bastion]] end up coming in for a quick assist (after starting a "distracting" fire) to injure Kaisik and banish him to the basement (along with Reginald!)

In the end, the crew finds Reginald's strong box and makes off with a fair bit of cash. The house ends up mostly burnt up, and the fate of Reginald and the vampiric butler is unknown!
