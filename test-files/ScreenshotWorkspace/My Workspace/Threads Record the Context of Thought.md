The fact that two notes may be connected with [[Wiki Links]] is a nice feature, but that connection in and of itself is not altogether useful. Notes could have many dozens of connections. Rather, by being able to see how you jumped from one note, to another, to another (and perhaps further still), you can begin to _feel_ the common thrust of a thought that connects all of the notes together along that axis.

This is very useful, as [[Expressing Thoughts is Difficult]], and there may be many adjacent or not-quite-perfect attempts before the thought can be properly crystalized into written language. Just as [[Writing is Crystalization]], getting a bird's eye view of how you've attempted capture an idea can aid in that process. It can be the mote of dust that starts the crystalline structure.
