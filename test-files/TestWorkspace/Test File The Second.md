There is different text here. A completely different file you might say.

Here is a [[test link]]. Okay, sweet. Here is an [[test link|alternate text link]]. Right on, my dude. Now, let's link to the [[TestFile]] nice and easy like.

[[New Test Note]] (Don't edit above this line or tests will break)

A [[I want mindmaps]].

[[Same Name]]

[[Subfile]]
