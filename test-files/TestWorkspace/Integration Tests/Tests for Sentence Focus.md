This is a normal sentence. And here is one right after. Here is some words.with.adjoining periods. Clearly not a sentence, right? And what about other sentence ends? Like this one!

And here's an empty line with no punctuation

And another line, but with punctuation. And "what about quotes?" Those should probably work too. And "quotes". But that's just a normal sentence.
