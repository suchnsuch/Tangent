## Skills to Train
### Update Default Cognition to Include Bloom's 4 and 5




Bloom’s Level 4 (Analyze) and Level 5 (Evaluate) are not “more thinking,” they’re **different moves**. You don’t rise into them accidentally; you install them as reflexes. Below are **simple, repeatable drills** that turn _contrast_ and _prioritization_ into habits instead of rare epiphanies.

---

## First: reframe the problem (important)
Your issue is not capability.
It’s **default cognition**.

Your brain is doing:

* Assimilate → compress → store → move on

What you want is:

* **Differentiate → compare → rank → store**

So the fix is **forced differentiation before storage**. Every exercise below does exactly that.

---

## Level 4 (Analyze): Make contrast unavoidable

### 1\. The “Two Axes” Drill (5 minutes)
Pick any idea. Draw two axes:

* X-axis: _Similar_
* Y-axis: _Different_

Force yourself to list:

* 3 ways it’s similar to something you already know
* **3 ways it’s fundamentally different**

Rule:
Differences must be **mechanism-level**, not surface traits.

Bad: “One is faster.”
Good: “One trades accuracy for speed via heuristic shortcuts.”

Do this **before** you decide you “understand” the idea.

This directly prevents over-assimilation.

---

### 2\. Contrast Triggers (habit installer)
Attach contrast to a fixed verbal cue.

Every time you learn something new, finish the sentence:

> “This looks like X, **but unlike X, it…**”

No exception.
No elegance required.
Clumsy is fine; missing is not.

This turns contrast into a reflex, not a project.

---

### 3\. Boundary Hunting
Ask only one question:

> “Where does this stop working?”

Find:

* One edge case
* One failure mode
* One context where the idea reverses

If you can’t do this, you don’t have Level 4 yet. Period.

---

## Level 5 (Evaluate): Prioritization as a muscle

### 4\. Forced Ranking (non-negotiable)
Take 3–5 ideas and rank them **even if they feel incomparable**.

Rules:

* No ties.
* You must name the criterion _before_ ranking.

Example criteria:

* Leverage
* Robustness
* Cost of being wrong
* Reversibility

The pain you feel here is literally the skill developing.

---

### 5\. One-Winner Rule
Given multiple options, answer:

> “If I could only keep **one**, which survives?”

Then answer:

> “Why does this one beat the runner-up _specifically_?”

This exposes hidden value hierarchies you didn’t know you had.

---

### 6\. Kill Your Favorite (weekly)
Pick an idea you like.
Argue—briefly but seriously—why it should **not** be used.

If it survives, great.
If it doesn’t, you just upgraded your mental map instead of fossilizing it.

---

## Anti–Memory Collapse Protocol (this is the core)
Before storing any concept, force these three outputs:

1. **Closest neighbor** (what it resembles)
2. **Sharp distinction** (what it is _not_)
3. **Ranked importance** (where it sits relative to alternatives)

If any of the three are missing, the idea is under-differentiated and will blur later.

That blur you’re describing?
That’s not forgetting.
That’s **conceptual overcrowding**.

---

## Final blunt truth
Insight isn’t the goal.
**Differentiation is.**

Insights feel good.
Differentiation prevents collapse.

Make contrast and prioritization _procedural_, not inspirational—and Bloom 4/5 stop being places you visit and start being where you live.




Good. These are the _right_ objections. I’ll make this concrete and operational, tied directly to your three sources. No fog.

---

## First: anchor the three sources
We’ll treat each source differently, because they _produce different kinds of confusion_.

1. **Old notes** → risk = _over-assimilation_ (“I already know this”)
2. **Books** → risk = _false coherence_ (“this chapter feels complete”)
3. **ICT videos** → risk = _fragmentation_ (“lots of parts, no spine”)

The exercises stay the same, but the **inputs and outputs differ**.

---

## Level 4 — Analyze (Contrast that sticks)

### A. Two Axes — made concrete

> “Do I just pull anything that feels salient?”

**No.** You pull the **nearest neighbor concept you already have**, not something random.

Think of it as:

> “If I were sloppy, what would I accidentally file this under?”

That’s your comparison target.

---

### Example 1: Old Notes
You’re rereading an atomic note about _“market structure shift”_.

**Nearest neighbor (X-axis: Similar):**

* Break of structure
* Trend change
* Higher high / lower low logic

**Y-axis (Different — mechanism-level):**

* Market structure shift requires **displacement + follow-through**, not just a wick
* It’s about _order flow control changing_, not price making a new extreme
* Timeframe dependency: valid only relative to the dealing range

You write this **before** linking the note.

---

### Example 2: Book (inspectional reading)
You hit a concept like _“first principles thinking.”_

Nearest neighbor:

* Reductionism
* Root cause analysis

Differences:

* First principles **rebuild**, not just analyze
* It discards analogies instead of refining them
* Higher upfront cost, higher long-term leverage

If you can’t write the differences, you’re still at Bloom 2–3.

---

### Example 3: ICT Video (fragmented idea)
ICT says something like:

> “Price seeks liquidity before expansion.”

Nearest neighbor:

* Stop hunting
* Mean reversion

Differences:

* Liquidity is a **means**, not the goal
* Expansion requires _imbalance_, not just stops
* Context-dependent: session + narrative required

Now it stops being mystical noise.

---

## Failure Mode (succinct and precise)
A **failure mode** is:

> _The specific way a concept breaks when its assumptions are violated._

Not “when it doesn’t work.”
But **how** it fails.

### Examples:
* Trading model failure mode: _range conditions collapse breakout logic_
* Note-taking failure mode: _over-linking causes concept blur_
* ICT idea failure mode: _liquidity taken but no displacement follows_

If you can name the failure mode, you understand the mechanism.

---

## Level 5 — Evaluate (Prioritization without confusion)

### “No ties” — what that actually means
It means:

> You are not allowed to say “these are equal.”

Because “equal” usually means:

* You haven’t chosen a criterion
* Or you’re avoiding commitment

Real decisions always break ties eventually. Do it early.

---

### Criterion — stripped down
A **criterion** is just:

> _The rule you’re using to decide what’s better._

You already gave a perfect example accidentally.

> “Rank these by how apple they are.”

That’s a criterion.

Now let’s make it relevant.

---

### Example 4: Old Notes (prioritizing concepts)
You have 5 trading concepts:

* Fair value gap
* Market structure shift
* Kill zones
* Liquidity pools
* Order blocks

**Criterion:** “Which most directly explains _why_ price moves?”

Rank them. No ties.

You’ll be forced to expose what you actually believe matters.

---

### Example 5: Book Ideas
You extract 4 ideas from a chapter.

**Criterion:** “Which idea would cause the largest behavior change if implemented?”

Rank them.

This prevents intellectual hoarding.

---

### Example 6: ICT Video Fragments
You collect 6 ideas from one video.

**Criterion:** “Which is required for the others to make sense?”

Rank them.

This builds structure out of chaos.

---

## Kill Your Favorite — clarified
Yes, your assumption is correct, but here’s the sharper version:

> Most ideas are **conditionally useful**, not inherently valuable.

“Killing” means:

* Identify the conditions where it **should not be used**
* If those conditions are common, it’s not a core idea

### Example:
You love a specific ICT model.

You ask:

* What session breaks it?
* What volatility regime breaks it?
* What market phase breaks it?

If it only works in narrow conditions, it’s a _tool_, not a _pillar_.

That distinction matters.

---

## Minimal daily loop (10–15 minutes)
For **any source**, do this:

1. Nearest neighbor (assimilation check)
2. One sharp difference (mechanism)
3. One failure mode
4. Rank vs 2–3 related ideas using one criterion

That’s it.

No journaling marathons.
No enlightenment required.
Just **forced differentiation before storage**.

This directly attacks the memory collapse you described.

[[Notes are for the Results of Thinking, not Thinking Itself]]


You’re circling the right distinction. The core issue is **not note types**. It’s **what kind of cognition gets externalized vs what stays internal**.

Short answer first, then detail:

> Yes, contrast and prioritization _should_ appear in notes — but **only in constrained, purpose-built ways**.
> Most of the work happens _before_ the note. Notes should capture **results of thinking**, not the thinking process itself.

If you store raw contrast everywhere, you get redundancy soup.
If you store none of it, you get definition sludge.

The goal is **selective crystallization**.

---

## First principle: Notes are not where you _think_
Notes are where you **freeze decisions**.

If a thought is still plastic, exploratory, or salience-training only → it stays in your head or scratch space.
If a thought has _stabilized_ → it earns a slot in a note.

This alone eliminates most redundancy.

---

## What belongs in a note (very specific)
For any concept-level note (atomic note, concept note, procedure note), only four things are allowed to be permanent:

### 1\. Function (not definition)
Replace:

> “X is…”

With:

> “X is used to…”

Function forces differentiation automatically.

---

### 2\. One contrast anchor (mandatory, single)
Every note gets **exactly one** contrast, no more.

Format:

> “Often confused with X, but differs because Y.”

Why only one?

* Prevents combinatorial explosion
* Forces you to choose the _most dangerous_ confusion

This is Bloom 4, but _compressed_.

---

### 3\. One priority signal (optional, but powerful)
Instead of ranking everything everywhere, use **local priority flags**.

Examples:

* “Core concept”
* “Supporting concept”
* “Conditional tool”
* “Derived heuristic”

This is Bloom 5 **without repetition**.

You are not ranking _here_; you are declaring _status_.

---

### 4\. Failure boundary (only if non-obvious)
Add only when it matters.

Format:

> “Breaks when…”

If the failure is trivial or universal, omit it.

---

## What should NOT go in notes
This is where most systems fail.

Do **not** store:

* Full compare/contrast tables
* Exploratory rankings
* Early salience training
* “Thinking out loud”

That belongs in:

* Scratch notes
* Daily logs
* Marginalia
* Temporary canvases

Once resolved, only the **decision residue** gets promoted.

---

## How this applies to your formats

### Atomic Notes
Atomic ≠ exhaustive.

A good atomic note is **sharp, asymmetric, opinionated**.

Bad atomic note:

> “Liquidity is…”

Good atomic note:

* Function
* One contrast
* One boundary

If two atomic notes feel redundant, it means:

> You froze thinking too early.

Not that atomic notes are bad.

---

### Source Notes (books, videos)
Source notes are **raw intake**.
They are allowed to be messy and repetitive.

But they should include **flags**, not conclusions:

* “Feels similar to X”
* “Unclear priority”
* “Fragment — missing mechanism”

These flags tell you _where_ to do Bloom 4/5 later.

---

### User Stories / Projects
Here is where **priority belongs most**.

Projects should explicitly state:

* What matters most
* What is intentionally ignored

If priority doesn’t show up here, it leaks into concept notes and bloats them.

---

## Redundancy: the real cause
Redundant notes don’t come from “too many notes.”
They come from:

> Storing multiple unresolved interpretations of the same thing.

Bloom 4/5 reduces redundancy **only if applied before promotion**.

---

## Practical rule (printable)
Before creating or updating a permanent note, ask:

1. What decision am I freezing?
2. What is the single most dangerous confusion?
3. Is this core, supporting, or conditional?
4. Do I know when it breaks?

If you can’t answer at least two, don’t promote it yet.

---

## Final distinction (this matters)

> Salience training changes _what you notice_.
> Notes preserve _what you’ve decided_.

You don’t write notes to become smarter.
You write notes so you **don’t have to think again** about settled ground.

Contrast and priority belong in notes **only after they’ve stabilized**.

That’s the philosophy you were missing.




Yes. Your diagnosis is correct: you have **open cognitive loops frozen as notes**. That is the root problem. Everything else is secondary.

What you need now is **damage control**, not elegance.

I’ll give you:

1. A definition of _done_ (global)
2. A temporary overhaul strategy
3. Quintessential versions of each note type
4. A per-note cleanup checklist
5. Where thinking belongs (and where it absolutely does not)
6. How Obsidian tools (Bases, Canvas) can help without becoming toys

No fluff.

---

## 1\. Global “Definition of Done” (non-negotiable)
A note is **done** when:

* It represents a **closed cognitive loop**
* It would not materially improve if you reread the source
* It contains _decisions_, not questions

If a note still contains:

* “I think…”
* “Not sure if…”
* Multiple unresolved interpretations

…it is **not a note**, it is a **thinking artifact** and should be treated as such.

---

## 2\. Damage Control Strategy (don’t boil the ocean)

### Phase 1: Triage (fast, brutal)
Do **not** try to fix everything at once.

Create three buckets (tags, folders, or Bases views):

1. **Stable** – leave alone
2. **Fragmented** – incomplete loops
3. **Dead** – no longer relevant

This is a _classification pass only_. No editing yet.

If unsure: Fragmented.

---

### Phase 2: Install a thinking quarantine
Yes, you _do_ need a place to think.

Use **Daily Notes / Tangent Journal** explicitly as:

> “Cognitive scratch space. Nothing here is permanent.”

Rules:

* All comparison, ranking, and exploratory thinking happens here
* No links created _from_ here to permanent notes
* Promotion is explicit and intentional

This single move will stop future damage.

---

## 3\. Quintessential versions (what “complete” looks like)

### A. Concept Notes (atomic or syntopical)
**Purpose:** Freeze understanding.

**Required fields:**

* **Function:** “Used when…”
* **Primary distinction:** “Not X because…”
* **Status:** Core / Supporting / Conditional
* **Failure boundary:** (only if meaningful)

If any are missing → not done.

---

### B. Procedure Notes
**Purpose:** Freeze causality.

Must include:

* Trigger condition
* Ordered steps
* Expected outcome
* Known break condition

If it reads like advice instead of a causal chain → redo.

---

### C. User Stories
These are already structured. Add only one thing:

* **Priority context:** Why _this_ story exists now

If not, it drifts into idea soup.

---

### D. Projects
Projects are **decision aggregators**, not knowledge stores.

Must state:

* Primary objective
* Top 1–2 constraints
* What is _explicitly deprioritized_

If a project doesn’t exclude things, it will contaminate concept notes.

---

### E. Source Notes (books, ICT videos)
Source notes are **allowed to be incomplete**.

But they must be labeled clearly as:

* Intake
* Fragment
* Question

Never upgrade them silently into concept notes.

---

## 4\. Per-note Cleanup Checklist (use this literally)
When upgrading an old note:

1. What problem was this trying to solve?
2. Is that problem still relevant?
	
	* If no → archive or delete
3. What is the _one_ idea worth keeping?
4. What is it often confused with?
5. Is it core, supporting, or conditional?
6. Where does it fail or stop applying?

If you can’t answer at least 4 → demote it to scratch or kill it.

---

## 5\. Redundancy elimination (how to do it safely)
When two notes feel similar, ask **only this**:

> “If I had to delete one forever, which would hurt more?”

Keep that one.
Merge any unique insights from the other.
Delete the rest.

No mercy. Redundancy is cognitive debt.

---

## 6\. Tooling (used surgically)

### Obsidian Bases
Excellent for:

* Surfacing notes missing required fields
* Finding “Fragmented” notes
* Auditing status flags (Core / Conditional)

Do not use Bases to _think_.

---

### Canvas
Use Canvas only for:

* Temporary comparison maps
* One-off ranking exercises
* Project-level synthesis

Canvas outputs must resolve into:

* A decision
* Or a promoted note

Otherwise delete the Canvas.

---

## Final framing (this is the mental shift)
Your old system:

> Thinking → Notes

Your new system:

> Thinking → **Decisions** → Notes

Notes are **artifacts of resolved cognition**, not containers for thought.

Once you enforce:

* A definition of done
* A quarantine for thinking
* A promotion gate

Bloom 4 and 5 stop being aspirational and start being **structural**.

At that point, the fragmentation collapses on its own.





You’re circling the right animal. You’ve correctly diagnosed the disease; now we’re just tuning the dosage so you don’t accidentally poison yourself while curing it.

I’ll break this into **what you’ve nailed**, **where this will quietly betray you**, and **how I’d harden the system without bloating it**.

---

## 1\. Your core mental model is correct (and non-negotiable)

> Exposure → HOT → spacing → HOT → spacing

That’s the skeleton. Anyone arguing with this is arguing with biology, not pedagogy.

What you’ve also correctly internalized:

* **Higher-order thinking is the lever**, not repetition.
* **Spacing is the gatekeeper**, not effort.
* **Salience beats volume** every single time.
* **“Release” is mandatory**, otherwise cognition turns into insomnia cosplay.

So philosophically: you’re aligned with Sung, Ahrens, Leitner, Bloom, and the general “stop being busy, start being effective” crowd. No red flags there.

---

## 2\. Your Anki failure wasn’t Anki’s fault (but you already know that)
Your Anki story is extremely common and extremely important:

* You **outsourced judgment to the algorithm**
* You **treated reviews as throughput**
* HOT collapsed under review pressure
* Learning degraded into cardio for your spacebar

The key insight you surfaced is gold:

> One card mattered because it collided with _current context_, not because it was “due.”

That means **salience + context > scheduling precision**.

So the lesson isn’t “ditch SR.”
It’s: **SR without deliberate cognitive intent becomes noise**.

This matters for Obsidian SR too. Hold that thought.

---

## 3\. Your Tangent / Atomic Notes phase fixed depth and broke time
You traded:

* shallow + frequent → deep + rare

That’s a _good trade initially_, but it predictably caused:

* Fragmentation
* Redundancy
* Concept islands
* Fear of letting go (“If I drop this, it dies forever”)

That fear is the biggest red flag in the entire post. Not because you’re weak—but because **your system wasn’t trusted to bring things back**.

A system that cannot be trusted will be micromanaged.
Micromanagement kills learning.

So your instinct to **formalize return paths** is exactly right.

---

## 4\. Using SR _on source notes_ is smart — with one big caveat
Your proposal:

> Use Obsidian SR. Mark source notes as hard/good/easy based on _unfinished cognitive business_.

This is **directionally excellent** and **conceptually sound**.

You’re not using SR to memorize.
You’re using SR to:

* Reopen cognitive loops
* Resume unfinished thinking
* Regulate priority via difficulty

That’s good. That’s mature. That’s leverage.

### BUT — here’s the trap 🪤
If you let **“ease” drift into “I feel calm about this”**, your system will lie to you.

Why?

Because:

* Familiar ≠ integrated
* Coherent ≠ transferable
* “Nothing left to say” ≠ “usable under pressure”

Your brain loves premature closure. It throws a party when ambiguity leaves.

So you need **hard criteria** for each rating.

---

## 5\. Redefine “Hard / Good / Easy” in operational terms
Here’s a version that won’t gaslight you later:

### HARD = “Cognitively unresolved”
Use when **any** of the following are true:

* You can’t explain how it _changes decisions_
* You can’t contrast it cleanly with neighboring concepts
* You sense it should connect elsewhere but don’t know where
* It spawns user stories but no procedures yet
* You’re still generating better questions than answers

Hard means: _“This still moves when I poke it.”_

---

### GOOD = “Structurally understood, not yet fluent”
Use when:

* You can explain it and critique it
* You know where it lives in the concept map
* You can apply it deliberately, but slowly
* It supports other ideas but doesn’t yet drive behavior automatically

Good means: _“I can work with this, but it still costs effort.”_

---

### EASY = “Operationally inert”
Use **sparingly**. Only when:

* It reliably influences judgment or prioritization
* It shows up naturally during problem-solving
* You’d notice immediately if it were missing
* Revisiting it produces no new distinctions _and_ no new links

Easy means: _“This already thinks through me.”_

Most people mark things easy when they should mark them good. Don’t be most people.

---

## 6\. One missing piece: a “return hook”
Right now your plan says:

> “I’ll come back later and pick up where I left off.”

That’s necessary—but not sufficient.

When you stop at 30 minutes, **leave a deliberate cognitive hook**. Not a TODO list. A _thinking hook_.

At the end of a session, append **one of these** to the source note:

* “Next time, I need to decide whether X or Y explains Z better”
* “This probably contradicts \[note\], but I haven’t checked”
* “I suspect this only works under these constraints”
* “If this were false, what would break?”

This does two things:

1. Reinstates context instantly on return
2. Forces HOT immediately instead of rereading

Without a hook, reviews degrade into reacquaintance.
With a hook, they become continuation.

---

## 7\. Your system is close — it just needs teeth
What you’re building is not a note system.
It’s a **cognitive traffic controller**.

To make it robust:

* SR schedules _returns_, not learning
* Difficulty encodes _unfinished thinking_, not comfort
* HOT happens **during** reviews, not before or after
* Release is mandatory because return is guaranteed

If you do this right:

* Fear of letting go disappears
* Redundancy collapses naturally
* Atomic notes consolidate instead of multiplying
* Bloom 4–5 becomes default, not aspirational

You’re not far off. You’re one layer of operational clarity away from something that actually deserves to be called a system.

If you want, next we can:

* Formalize **what each note type is allowed to do**
* Design **review modes** (not just review schedules)
* Or build a clean bridge between **user stories ↔ procedures ↔ concepts**

Your move.



Good. Your response confirms you’re seeing the _right_ failure modes, not just inventing new rituals to feel productive. I’ll respond in layers and keep it structural.

---

## 1\. The “energy-conserving brain” point matters more than people admit
You’re pointing at a real phenomenon, even if the labels are fuzzy. The important part isn’t the named paradox; it’s this:

> **The brain confuses reduced friction with competence.**

When effort drops, confidence rises—even if performance wouldn’t survive contact with reality.

That’s why:

* Recognition feels like mastery
* Familiarity feels like understanding
* Calm feels like “done”

Your instinct to _preemptively guard against that_ is exactly what separates a serious system from a vibes-based one.

So yes: any “easy” marker must be hostile to comfort. If it rewards comfort, it will rot.

---

## 2\. “Knowledge collapse” is a real and deadly failure mode
Your bronze vs salad metaphor is excellent, and it nails the issue precisely.

What you experienced is what I’d call **over-assimilation without differentiation**.

At Bloom 4:

* Similarity _without contrast_ causes identity loss
* New ideas become aliases instead of nodes
* Retrieval works (“I recognize this”), but selection fails (“Which one do I use?”)

This explains why:

* Everything feels easy
* Nothing feels sharp
* Judgment degrades instead of improving

The fix is not “more comparison.”
It’s **forced contrast + forced prioritization**.

Which leads to an important refinement…

---

## 3\. Bloom 4 is incomplete without Bloom 5 constraints
Most people treat Bloom 4 as “compare & contrast.”
That’s insufficient.

**Contrast must answer at least one of these questions:**

* What does this idea _exclude_ that the other allows?
* What breaks if I substitute A for B?
* What environment favors one over the other?

Without that, similarity wins by default, and collapse happens.

Bloom 5 then **locks identity** by answering:

* _When would I deliberately choose this over its neighbors?_

This is why your “definitions of done” instinct is right. Identity is stabilized by _decision boundaries_, not descriptions.

---

## 4\. Refinement to the “Hard / Good / Easy” model (important)
Given what you’ve said, I’d tighten them slightly further:

### HARD (Unstable identity)
* Actively collapsing into neighboring ideas
* Boundaries unclear or untested
* Cannot survive substitution tests
* Generates insights but not decisions

This is where **knowledge collapse risk is highest**.

---

### GOOD (Stable identity, weak selectivity)
* Clearly distinct from neighbors
* Can explain _why it is not the others_
* Still slow or effortful to choose under pressure
* Works in isolation, not yet reflexive

This is where most _useful learning_ actually lives.

---

### EASY (Decision-grade)
Only mark easy if:

* You reliably choose it correctly in live contexts
* You notice immediately when it’s misapplied
* It constrains other ideas (it has gravity)
* Substitution errors feel obviously wrong

If it doesn’t _push back_ when misused, it’s not easy.

This framing directly prevents bronzeification.

---

## 5\. The “return hook” + station question insight is a big deal
You independently arrived at the same mechanism Sung and Newport are pointing at from different angles.

The shared principle:

> **Context must be recoverable faster than it decays.**

Station questions / return hooks work because they:

* Reactivate the same constraints
* Reload the same unresolved tensions
* Restore relevance immediately

This is the difference between:

* “Reviewing a note”
* “Continuing a thought”

If your review doesn’t feel like continuation, it’s just rereading with a calendar.

---

## 6\. Spaced repetition and Task Board are _not_ redundant — they solve different failure modes
Here’s the clean mental separation:

### Spaced Repetition answers:

> **“When should this idea come back into awareness?”**

### Task Board answers:

> **“What concrete actions are still blocking understanding?”**

SR manages _attention over time_.
Task boards manage _incomplete work across contexts_.

They only become redundant if you misuse one to do the other’s job.

---

## 7\. The big-picture integration (big brush strokes only)
What you’re converging toward is this:

1. **Encounter idea**
2. **Classify it cognitively**
	
	* Concept / Procedure / etc.
	* Which Bloom levels are required?
3. **Generate obligations**
	
	* Compare with X
	* Contrast with Y
	* Practice Z
	* Test under condition W
4. **Do what fits the current time box**
5. **Externalize the rest**
	
	* As checkboxes (Task Board)
	* As return hooks (thinking continuation)
6. **Let SR decide _when_, not _what_, comes back**

The key rule:

* **Unfinished thinking → SR**
* **Unfinished doing → Task Board**

If you keep that separation clean, the system won’t fight itself.

---

## 8\. One lightbulb to leave you with
Right now, your fear isn’t “forgetting.”
It’s **losing epistemic control**—ideas slipping away before they’re stabilized.

The moment your system can _reliably return you to unstable ideas with their tension intact_, that fear will evaporate.

And when that fear goes away:

* You’ll release ideas faster
* You’ll think more sharply
* You’ll stop overworking notes out of self-defense

Next natural step, when you’re ready:

* Formalize **definitions of done per note type**
* Especially: Concepts vs Procedures (they stabilize very differently)

Stop here. Let this settle. Then we’ll tighten the next bolt.





Good snag. This is a real systems problem, not a philosophical one. If you don’t resolve it cleanly, you’ll either recreate Anki-style review debt or neuter the whole thing by being overly cautious.

I’ll tackle this in four parts:

1. **The transition problem (old → new)**
2. **When a note earns the right to be spaced**
3. **How to soft-start without lying to yourself**
4. **How note types change the rules**

---

## 1\. The transition problem is not “too many notes” — it’s _too many obligations_
Anki burned you because **every card immediately became a promise**.

The lesson isn’t “go slower.”
It’s **separate existence from obligation**.

Your vault can contain thousands of notes.
Your _active cognitive system_ cannot.

So the rule must be:

> **A note does not enter spacing just because it exists, is opened, or is edited.**

Spacing is not archival.
Spacing is not indexing.
Spacing is **a commitment to revisit thinking**.

That distinction solves half the problem immediately.

---

## 2\. A note earns spacing only after a cognitive act (not a mechanical one)
Here’s the clean criterion:

> **Inject a note into SR only when you deliberately attempt higher-order thinking on it.**

Not when:

* You link it
* You clean it up
* You reword something
* You reference it for another task
* You touch it incidentally while doing real work

Yes, even if you improve it.
Yes, even if it’s “important.”

Those are _maintenance actions_, not learning actions.

---

### The litmus test
Ask yourself one question:

> _“Did I try to move this note up Bloom’s ladder just now?”_

If no → **no spacing**
If yes → **spacing is appropriate**

That keeps SR honest and bounded.

---

## 3\. Soft start: your instinct is right, but here’s the precise framing
Starting with “easy / old / core” ideas is correct — **but for the wrong reason** if you’re not careful.

You’re not doing this because they’re easy.
You’re doing it because they are **low-risk to schedule**.

Older ideas:

* Already have identity
* Already have contrast
* Already have context
* Won’t spawn 15 unfinished obligations

So here’s the proper soft-start rule:

> **Bootstrap the system using notes that are already Bloom-4 stable.**

Not “things I like.”
Not “things I know.”
Things that:

* Do not collapse into others
* Do not explode into tasks
* Do not demand practice blocks you can’t honor yet

This seeds:

* Longer intervals early
* Fewer near-term reviews
* A sense of system trust

Which prevents review debt without artificial throttling.

---

## 4\. Why “everything is new at first” is not actually true
This is an important reframing.

Yes, everything is _unscheduled_.
No, everything is not _new_.

Your vault already contains:

* Decision-grade concepts
* Stable mental models
* Operational knowledge you use daily

Those should space out almost immediately.

So early imbalance is only dangerous if:

* You inject unstable ideas too fast
* You treat spacing as default instead of earned

If you follow the “cognitive act required” rule, the system self-regulates.

---

## 5\. Old notes: migrate by _touch_, not by sweep
Do **not** do a mass migration.
Do **not** batch-convert.
Do **not** say “I’ll process the old vault.”

That recreates the Anki excitement → debt arc.

Instead:

> **Old notes enter the new system only when they collide with current thinking.**

You open one because:

* A project needs it
* A comparison demands it
* A contradiction surfaces

If you then _engage HOT_ → space it.
If not → leave it inert.

This ensures:

* Migration is relevance-driven
* Review load reflects actual thinking
* Old junk never becomes obligation

---

## 6\. Tasks, projects, and “the right side” change everything (important)
You made a critical observation:

> _We don’t do ideas. We do projects._

Correct. Which means:

* **Left side (notes)** exists to _support judgment_
* **Right side (projects/tasks)** exists to _express action_

This gives you a powerful rule:

> **If an idea is not currently feeding a project, it is optional.**

Optional things should not generate mandatory reviews.

So:

* Project-linked concepts → higher priority, tighter spacing
* Free-floating concepts → slower, lighter, or deferred spacing

This naturally prevents overload because _life constrains learning_.

---

## 7\. Where Task Board fits (big brush strokes only)
You’re right to be cautious here.

The correct division of labor:

* **SR** tracks _unfinished thinking_
* **Task Board** tracks _unfinished doing_

If a concept review reveals:

* “I need to practice this”
* “I need to test this in situation X”
* “I need to compare this against Y”

Those become tasks.
They do **not** require the note itself to be rescheduled sooner.

This prevents the common failure mode:

> “I keep reviewing the idea instead of doing the thing.”

SR brings the _question_ back.
Tasks handle the _work_.

---

## 8\. One stabilizing principle to anchor all of this
If you take nothing else, take this:

> **Only schedule what you are willing to revisit at the level you left it.**

Not:

* “Important”
* “Relevant”
* “I touched it”

But:

* “I opened a loop I intend to close later.”

This single rule prevents burnout, debt, and system distrust.

---

You’re asking the right questions at the right time. This is the phase where systems either harden or quietly turn into self-punishment engines.

Next time, when you’re ready, we can:

* Formalize **entry criteria per note type**
* Or define **what “Bloom-4 stable” actually means operationally**
* Or design a **daily/weekly cadence** that keeps SR subordinate to real work

But you needed this clarity first. You were right to pause here.





Good. Now we’re at the layer where this stops being “a philosophy of learning” and becomes **an operating system**. I’ll stay procedural, big-picture, and gate-oriented, exactly as you asked.

I’ll structure this as:

1. The **three identity states** (unstable → stable → decision-grade)
2. The **gates** between them (what actually moves a note forward)
3. **What you do at each stage** (procedurally, not aspirationally)
4. **Prioritization rules** (what moves now vs later)
5. **Transition strategy** (old → new without debt)
6. Key **themes / invariants** that keep the system sane

---

## 1\. The three identity states (this is the backbone)
Forget Bloom for a second. Bloom explains _thinking depth_, but identity explains _system behavior_.

### A. Unstable Identity
This is where ideas are dangerous.

Characteristics:

* Blends into neighboring concepts
* Feels intuitive but slippery
* Easy to recognize, hard to select
* Generates questions faster than answers
* Cannot survive substitution tests

Operationally:

* This is where **knowledge collapse happens**
* This is where most “false mastery” lives

These notes are **high cognitive risk**.

---

### B. Stable Identity
This is where ideas stop melting.

Characteristics:

* Clear boundaries
* Explicit contrasts
* You can explain why it is _not_ similar ideas
* Substitution errors are visible (but still possible)
* Slow but deliberate application

This is Bloom-4 done _properly_.

These notes are **safe to store**, but not yet trustworthy under pressure.

---

### C. Decision-Grade (Judgment-Capable)
This is where ideas earn authority.

Characteristics:

* Chosen correctly in live contexts
* Actively constrain other ideas
* Misuse feels obviously wrong
* Shape prioritization and tradeoffs
* Influence behavior without prompting

This is Bloom-5 territory.

These notes have **gravitational pull** in your thinking.

---

## 2\. The gates (what actually moves a note)
A system without gates turns into vibes. These are your gates.

---

### Gate 1: Entry into the Learning System
**Question:**

> “Did I deliberately attempt higher-order thinking on this?”

Criteria:

* You tried to compare, contrast, test, or situate it
* You opened a cognitive loop on purpose
* You generated unresolved questions or obligations

If yes:

* It may enter SR
	If no:
* It stays inert (even if edited)

This prevents obligation inflation.

---

### Gate 2: Unstable → Stable Identity
**Question:**

> “Can this idea survive contrast?”

Minimum criteria:

* Explicitly contrasted with at least one neighbor
* Differences articulated in _function_, not wording
* Substitution failure identified (“If I swap these, X breaks”)

This is where your bronze → salad problem is solved.

Until this gate is passed:

* Mark HARD
* Shorter spacing
* Expect return hooks

---

### Gate 3: Stable → Decision-Grade
**Question:**

> “Does this idea now participate in judgment?”

Minimum criteria:

* Clear selection rules (“I choose this when…”)
* Contextual constraints identified
* Evidence of correct use or correction after misuse
* Influences prioritization elsewhere

This is not about elegance.
It’s about **reliable choice under uncertainty**.

Only here does “easy” make sense.

---

## 3\. What you actually _do_ at each stage
This is the part most systems hand-wave. No hand-waving.

---

### Stage 1: Unstable Identity (Exploration mode)
Your job:

* Reduce ambiguity
* Prevent collapse
* Create contrast

Typical actions:

* Compare against 1–3 neighboring ideas
* Write “This is NOT…” statements
* Generate substitution tests
* Create return hooks / station questions

What you do _not_ do:

* Try to finalize
* Over-summarize
* Declare mastery

System behavior:

* SR = active, short intervals
* Tasks = only if action is required to resolve identity

---

### Stage 2: Stable Identity (Consolidation mode)
Your job:

* Strengthen boundaries
* Increase fluency
* Test applicability

Typical actions:

* Apply in controlled contexts
* Link into concept maps
* Refine definitions based on use
* Surface edge cases

What you do _not_ do:

* Obsessively revisit
* Over-compare everything again

System behavior:

* SR = moderate spacing
* Tasks = practice, application, testing

---

### Stage 3: Decision-Grade (Judgment mode)
Your job:

* Let it work
* Watch for misuse
* Correct drift

Typical actions:

* Use it in projects
* Let it influence decisions
* Notice when it pushes back

What you do _not_ do:

* Review it “just because”
* Keep polishing the note

System behavior:

* SR = long spacing or none
* Tasks = none unless misuse is detected

---

## 4\. Prioritization rules (this keeps the system from exploding)
Priority is not “what’s interesting.”
It’s **what reduces risk fastest**.

### Highest priority:
* Unstable ideas feeding active projects
* Concepts currently collapsing
* Notes spawning repeated confusion

### Medium priority:
* Stable ideas becoming more relevant
* Concepts transitioning toward judgment

### Lowest priority:
* Stable but unused ideas
* Decision-grade ideas not currently active
* Inert archival notes

This alone prevents review debt.

---

## 5\. Transition strategy (old → new)
This is critical.

### Rule 1: No mass onboarding
Old notes migrate only when:

* They collide with current work
* They are needed for contrast
* They are explicitly engaged via HOT

### Rule 2: Most old notes start as “stable”
They already passed identity formation.
They do not need short intervals.

Bootstrap with:

* Core concepts
* Frequently used models
* Things that already shape decisions

### Rule 3: Let relevance drive migration
Your vault is not a backlog.
It’s a **terrain**.

You don’t “process terrain.”
You walk through it.

---

## 6\. Key themes (the invariants holding this together)
These show up everywhere in what you’re doing:

* **Obligation is the real cost**, not notes
* **Identity precedes mastery**
* **Contrast stabilizes, prioritization empowers**
* **SR schedules attention, not learning**
* **Tasks handle doing, SR handles thinking**
* **Decision-grade ideas earn authority; others borrow it**

If you violate any of these, the system starts lying to you.

---

### Where this naturally goes next
When you’re ready (not now unless you want):

* Formal **definitions of done per note type**
* A clean **daily / weekly operating cadence**
* Or a concrete **review protocol** for each identity state

But at this point, you’re no longer guessing. You’re designing with constraints, and that’s the difference between a learning system and a note hobby.

Sit with this. The shape matters more than the details right now.





Good. This is the correct next pressure point. Until “done” is mechanically recognizable, everything upstream stays fuzzy and emotionally expensive.

I’ll do this in a **clean matrix**, not prose soup:

1. **Identity states (unstable → stable → decision-grade)**
2. **Applied across major note types**
3. With **definitions of done you can actually check**

No poetry. No vibes.

---

# PART 1 — Identity states (universal, regardless of note type)
These states apply everywhere. The _expression_ changes by note type.

---

## 1\. UNSTABLE IDENTITY
**Definition:** The thing cannot yet stand on its own.

**Global signals:**

* Collapses into neighbors
* Generates questions but not decisions
* Feels interesting but unsafe
* Requires active attention to not distort

**Global “done” condition:**
➡ **Not done. By definition.**
Your only job is to move it toward stability or explicitly park it.

---

## 2\. STABLE IDENTITY
**Definition:** The thing has a clear shape and boundary.

**Global signals:**

* Can be distinguished from similar things
* Can be explained without self-contradiction
* Survives substitution tests
* Still requires effort to apply well

**Global “done” condition:**
➡ **Identity is firm, but authority is not.**

This is the first legitimate “done.”

---

## 3\. DECISION-GRADE
**Definition:** The thing reliably participates in judgment.

**Global signals:**

* Chosen correctly under pressure
* Pushes back when misused
* Constrains other options
* Produces predictable outcomes

**Global “done” condition:**
➡ **Autonomous value. Works without supervision.**

This is the second and final “done.”

---

# PART 2 — Definitions of done by NOTE TYPE
Now we apply those states _concretely_.

---

## A. SOURCE NOTES
**Purpose:** Capture external information with minimal distortion.

### Unstable
* Raw excerpts
* No synthesis
* No positioning

**Done?** ❌ Never done here.

---

### Stable (DONE)
* Cleaned, scoped, and attributed
* Key claims isolated
* Obvious noise removed

**Definition of done (checklist):**

* I know why I saved this
* I know what problem it speaks to
* I could safely mine this later

➡ Source notes **do not become decision-grade**.
Their job ends at stability.

---

## B. ATOMIC / CONCEPT NOTES
**Purpose:** Carry meaning, not information.

### Unstable
* Vague definition
* Blends into neighbors
* No contrast

**Done?** ❌ No.

---

### Stable (DONE #1)
* Explicit contrasts written
* Boundaries stated
* “This is not…” articulated

**Checklist:**

* At least one clear neighbor contrast
* Substitution failure identified
* Can be explained in isolation

---

### Decision-Grade (DONE #2)
* Clear selection rules
* Used correctly in real contexts
* Shapes judgment elsewhere

**Checklist:**

* I know when _not_ to use this
* It influences prioritization
* Misuse is obvious to me

---

## C. PROCEDURES / SYSTEMS
**Purpose:** Produce outcomes.

### Unstable
* Steps unclear
* Works only in theory
* Not repeatable

**Done?** ❌ No.

---

### Stable (DONE #1)
* Repeatable sequence
* Known inputs/outputs
* Known failure modes

**Checklist:**

* Someone else could follow this
* It works in controlled conditions
* I know what breaks it

---

### Decision-Grade (DONE #2)
* Used reliably in live conditions
* Adapted when needed
* Produces expected results

**Checklist:**

* I trust this under pressure
* I adjust it consciously, not accidentally
* It saves time or cognitive load

---

## D. USER STORIES (DESIRES, INTENTS)
**Purpose:** Articulate motivation and direction.

### Unstable
* Vague wants
* Emotion-driven
* No constraints

**Done?** ❌ No.

---

### Stable (DONE #1)
* Clear desire + context
* Tradeoffs acknowledged
* Conflicts surfaced

**Checklist:**

* I know what this costs
* I know what it competes with
* It’s not just a mood

---

### Decision-Grade (DONE #2)
* Converts into projects naturally
* Survives time and friction
* Worth doing for its own sake

**Checklist:**

* I’d still choose this after a bad week
* It aligns with other priorities
* It doesn’t need justification anymore

---

## E. PROJECTS
**Purpose:** Create change in the world.

### Unstable
* Idea soup
* No finish line
* No constraints

**Done?** ❌ No.

---

### Stable (DONE #1)
* Clear outcome
* Defined scope
* Next actions identified

**Checklist:**

* I know when this is finished
* I know the next 1–3 actions
* I know why it matters

---

### Decision-Grade (DONE #2)
* Self-propelling
* Survives friction
* Produces value independently

**Checklist:**

* I return to it without forcing
* Progress compounds
* Killing it would feel like a loss

---

# PART 3 — Cross-cutting rules (these prevent chaos)
These apply everywhere.

### Rule 1: Stability is the minimum viable “done”
If it’s not stable, it’s a liability.

---

### Rule 2: Decision-grade is earned, not declared
Time + pressure + correction are required.

---

### Rule 3: Not all note types need decision-grade
* Source notes stop at stable
* Concepts, procedures, projects can go further

---

### Rule 4: “Done” ≠ “Inactive”
Decision-grade things may never need review again.
That’s success, not neglect.

---

## Final framing (important)
You’re not building a system to **finish notes**.
You’re building a system to **promote ideas to autonomy**.

Unstable things need supervision.
Stable things can be stored.
Decision-grade things can be trusted.

That’s the hierarchy your entire system is converging toward.

When you’re ready next:

* We can map **review behaviors per state**
* Or design a **daily operating loop**
* Or tighten **Bloom-4 vs Bloom-5 mechanically**

For now, this gives you the scaffolding you were missing.
