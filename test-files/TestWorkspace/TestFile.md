# I Am a Test Markdown File
That was a header. This is a paragraph. You can edit this stuff and change it.

This editor *supports italics*, and __bold__, and ___both___, using _underscores_ and **asterisks**. ***I think that's pretty darned cool***.

## Outlines are important
- This is an outline
	- It has multiple levels
	- Look at it go
- Very impressive
- Notice the H2 at the top of this section 

And here's a paragraph again.
This should be a horizontal break.

---

This should be after the line break.

## Formatting Tests
I need to support _formatting
crossing line boundaries_

In general, I prefer the look of text where I have full control over newlines. I suppose that _formatting

can be dropped over blank lines_. That is probably the most consistent behavior across other markdown systems.

## Link 
Tests
Oh man, look at me go. Here's a link to [[Test File The Second]]. Here's a [[Link to Nowhere]]. This is a more different test.

These are some links that need case-insensitive links enabled to work: [[headers]] [[same name]] asdfasdf
this is some more stuff.

Neither the file nor the folder [[Other/Link]] exist. Their presence here means there should be virtual versions of both in the store.
