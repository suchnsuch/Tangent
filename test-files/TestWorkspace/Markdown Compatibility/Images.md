# External Images
I should be able to link to an external image with standard markdown. e.g. 
![200](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/htm/images/a/af/Video_Color_Test_Pattern.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20140102004737) And this should resolve itself nicely

# Local Images
You should be able to embed _local_ images via wiki links, e.g.
![[Test Image.jpg|500]]
You should also be able to embed local images through relative markdown links, e.g. ![200](../Test Image.jpg) 

And also with encoded URIs:
![200](../Test%20Image.jpg) 

![[Test Image]]
