Inline code `needs to render as a monospace font`.

When `surrounded` by spaces, it should have a little extra space on the edge.

When `next to a non-space, non-format character`, that character should be right up against it.

It should ``be able to contain ` characters if it is opened & closed by two or more``. This should be based on visible characters, and should work when _`made italic`_.

It should `defeat _all_ other [inline](http://google.com) formatting`.

It should defeat misspellings such as `hurpderp` hurpderp.

Inline code should not affect the line spacing of the line that it is on. You should be able to toggle this: `Lots of text right here.
This is a line break so that toggling code doesn't flow to it.

`Code by itself should be normal`
