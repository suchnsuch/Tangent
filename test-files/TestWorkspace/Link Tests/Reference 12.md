This will link to [[Nexus]], and it's going to do so in a way that takes up as much space as possible. This way, the in-link block becomes much larger and I don't need to create _even more_ damned reference notes. This should __really__ be fine. Do you like how I snuck in some additional markdown formatting in there? Pretty clever if I do say so myself. I noticed that having lots of content in lots of places actually makes it harder to make the link section bigger, so I'm back here making this already large paragraph absolutely massive. It's really a silly size. Who decided that this was the right size to use? Well, it was me. I'm the guy in charge. I make the decisions. I'm the decider. Unlike our previous decider-in-chief, I probably won't take up painting in retirement, but we'll see; anything is possible.
