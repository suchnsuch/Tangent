# Tangent Electron
This is an implementation of the Tangent note-writing toolset using Electron.

## Installation & Setup
As this exists inside of a monorepo, be sure to run `npm i` or `npm ci` at the root of the repository.

You will also need to build Typewriter in `../../lib/typewriter` with `npm run build`.

Once dependencies have been installed, you can run `npm run dev` to start up a development version of the editor.
